ChatGPT prompt included per instructions:

Please write a Python program to solve each of the following questions. 

Create a folder named hw6, in your vscode environment. Create one Python file for each question: easy.py, medium.py, hard.py

You are highly encouraged to use ChatGPT.  You MUST include any prompts/questions you entered into ChatGPT, as a comment in your code.

Easy: (3 points)
1. Given an array of integers, write a function to calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
Analyze the time complexity of your solution using Big O notation, especially what is the Big O notation of the code you wrote, and include it in the comments of your program.

Deliverables in Github: Create a folder, hw6, in your private repo, and add the files named easy.py, medium.py, hard.py.  These files should contain the code to solve each problem.

    Return the sum of all elements in the iterable.

    We use an explicit loop to make the operation clear; using Python's built-in
    sum(nums) is also correct and equivalent in time complexity.

    Time Complexity (Big-O):
        O(n) â€” we visit each element exactly once.
    Space Complexity:
        O(1) auxiliary space (ignoring input storage).
